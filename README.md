# Task List Manager

This project is a rework of the previous Task List Manager project, now built using React and Vite instead of vanilla JS. It allows users to add, mark as done, and delete tasks. The tasks are now saved in the browser's localStorage, so they persist even after the page is reloaded. 

## Disclaimer

As with the previous version, this one was built as part of an online course by Programação Web on Youtube and Cursa.
